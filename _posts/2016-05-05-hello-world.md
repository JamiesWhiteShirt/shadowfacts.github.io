Hello, again, world! Welcome to the third iteration of my website. Originally my site was hosted on GitHub pages and only available at [shadowfacts.github.io](https://shadowfacts.github.io). I wrote a couple of tutorials on using [Forge](http://minecraftforge.net) to mod 1.6.4, but never really finished anything other than super basic setup/recipes. Later, after I got [shadowfacts.net](https://shadowfacts.net), I decided to set up a propper website using [WordPress](https://wordpress.org). I copied over all of the old tutorials from my old GitHub pages site, but never really did anything else with it. After my website being offline for almost a year, I've finally decided to switch back to GitHub for the simplicity (also I <3 [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)). Using Jekyll, I've got a structure in place that I can use to easily publish tutorials in a structured format. There is one tutorial series that I'm currently writing and that is [Forge Mods in 1.9](/tutorials/forge-modding-19/), and hopefully more series will follow.
